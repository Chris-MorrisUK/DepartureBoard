# DepartureBoard
Primarily a demonstator for the UK rail DARWIN data feed, this uses WPF and an MVVM design pattern to create a simple departure board.

Note that you will need your own access token, available at: http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/100296.aspx in order as to use this code.
The station shown and the walking distances from that station are in the project settings file.
